Nmap Basics – Day Lesson Summary
What I Learned Today

1. Purpose of Nmap

Nmap is a network scanning tool used for enumeration and reconnaissance.

Helps identify live hosts, open ports, and services running on a target.

2. Port Scanning

Ports direct traffic to the correct application.

Total ports: 65535, standard “well-known” ports are 0–1023.

Common ports: HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), SMB(445), NETBIOS(139).

3. Common Scan Types

TCP Connect Scan (-sT) → Full 3-way handshake.

SYN Scan (-sS) → Half-open / stealth scan.

UDP Scan (-sU) → Stateless scan, slower.

NULL (-sN), FIN (-sF), Xmas (-sX) → Stealthy, open|filtered detection.

4. Useful Nmap Switches

-Pn → Treat host as alive, bypass ICMP blocks.

-p → Specify port(s) or ranges.

-sV → Service version detection.

-O → OS detection.

--script=<category> → Run NSE scripts (e.g., ftp-anon).

-v → Verbosity, -vv for more details.

-oN/-oG/-oX → Save scan results in different formats.

--reason → Shows why Nmap marked a port open/filtered.

5. NSE Scripts

Scripts are written in Lua.

Categories: safe, vuln, exploit, auth, brute, discovery.

Example: ftp-anon checks for anonymous FTP login.

6. Firewall Evasion Techniques

Fragment packets -f or --mtu <size>.

Add delays --scan-delay <ms>.

Append random data --data-length <num>.

7. Key Takeaways

Always start with enumeration.

Use SYN scans for stealth and speed.

UDP and stealth scans may show open|filtered.

NSE scripts extend Nmap functionality for vulnerabilities and info gathering.
