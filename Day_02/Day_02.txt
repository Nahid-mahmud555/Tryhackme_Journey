Networking & DNS Summary

= Over the course of these tasks, you've explored the fundamentals of networking, focusing on the TCP/IP model, domain name resolution, and key networking tools.

 1. Networking Models

= The TCP/IP model has 4 layers:
= Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Interface.

= It maps to the 7-layer OSI model, which is commonly used for learning.

= The Transport Layer in both models handles protocols like TCP (connection-based) and UDP (connectionless).

= TCP uses a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a reliable connection.

 2. DNS (Domain Name System)

= DNS translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.

= The DNS lookup process involves several steps:

= Hosts File – Local file checked first.

= DNS Cache – Previously stored results.

= Recursive DNS Server – Provided by your ISP or a public DNS like Google.

= Root Name Servers

= Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Servers

= Authoritative Name Servers – Store actual DNS records.

 3. Tools You Used

= ping – Tests if a host is reachable.

= traceroute – Shows the path your request takes to reach a server.

= dig – Manually queries DNS records and shows TTL values (in seconds).

= TTL (Time to Live) defines how long a DNS record stays cached (e.g., 86400 seconds = 24 hours).

* Extra Knowledge

= Google’s Public DNS servers:

= Primary: 8.8.8.8

= Secondary: 8.8.4.4

= The registrant city for microsoft.com is Redmond.

= The nearest golf course to Microsoft HQ is The Golf Club at Redmond Ridge.

= WHOIS lookups help reveal domain registration details like registrant contact and tech email (msnhst@microsoft.com for Microsoft).
