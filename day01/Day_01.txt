 02. Navigating the Filesystem
 
=   Essential commands for managing files and directories:

--  ls → list contents
-- cd → change directory
-- cat → read file contents
-- pwd → print working directory


03. Searching for Files

-- find → locate files by name or extension
-- grep → search inside files for specific text


04. Shell Operators

-- & → run command in background
-- && → chain commands
-- > → redirect output to a file (overwrite)
-- >> → append output to a file
